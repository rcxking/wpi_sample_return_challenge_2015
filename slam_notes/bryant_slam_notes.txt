--------

1) 2D-I-SLSJF
-------------
Creates a large map from many smaller local maps.  Uses feature extraction to determine if two local maps were made close to each other.  Works for 2D/3D SLAM -sample MATLAB code provided for 2D case.   

2) CAS Toolbox
--------------
Not a SLAM algorithm; allows MATLAB users to provide their own sensors/algorithms.

3) CEKF-SLAM
------------
MATLAB-based feature map SLAM simulator with Kalman Filters.  No support.

4) COP-SLAM
-----------
Algorithm for pure 3D SLAM navigation.  Uses pose-chains as input.  MATLAB code provided. 

5) DP-SLAM
----------
Featureless SLAM algorithm. Particle filtering used to create a joint probability distribution for maps/robot position.  Requires a LIDAR or Laser sensor.  Implementation provided in C++.
