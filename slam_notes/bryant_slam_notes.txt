--------

1) 2D-I-SLSJF
-------------
Creates a large map from many smaller local maps.  Uses feature extraction to determine if two local maps were made close to each other.  Works for 2D/3D SLAM -sample MATLAB code provided for 2D case.   

2) CAS Toolbox
--------------
Not a SLAM algorithm; allows MATLAB users to provide their own sensors/algorithms.

3) CEKF-SLAM
------------
MATLAB-based feature map SLAM simulator with Kalman Filters.  No support.

4) COP-SLAM
-----------
Algorithm for pure 3D SLAM navigation.  Uses pose-chains as input.  MATLAB code provided. 

5) DP-SLAM
----------
Featureless SLAM algorithm. Particle filtering used to create a joint probability distribution for maps/robot position.  Requires a LIDAR or Laser sensor.  Implementation provided in C++. 
----------
6) HOG-Man
Graph based formulation:
-Vertices: pose of the robot (Position + orientation)
-Edges: observation/odometry.
----------
7) Two problems addressed:
- Construct graph from sensors data. (front-end)
- Compute most likely configuration of the poses (back-end) + uncertainty

Seems to be lightweight
----------
8) ISam
“iSAM has successfully been used online on a range of mobile robot platforms, including ground robots (DARPA LAGR platform, Willow Garage PR2)”
Interesting: DARPA LAGR: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_LAGR_Program (unfortunatelly it uses GPS)
Seems to have a good documentation: http://people.csail.mit.edu/kaess/isam/doc/Example.html
----------
9) Max-Misture
Not available.
----------
10) MTK:
Not a SLAM…
Toolkit to develop algorithms that work in manifolds.
